      <h2>What is Decryption?</h2>
      <p>
        Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original, readable form. When you encrypt a file, it is transformed into a secure, unreadable format using a specific algorithm and a password. Decryption reverses this process, allowing you to access the original content of the file.
      </p>

      <h2>How Decryption Works on This Website</h2>
      <p>
        On this website, decryption is a straightforward process that ensures your files are securely restored to their original state. Here's how it works:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Upload the Encrypted File:</strong>
          <p>
            Start by clicking the "Choose File" button on the homepage and selecting the encrypted file you want to decrypt. The file name will be displayed next to the button to confirm your selection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Click the "Decrypt" Button:</strong>
          <p>
            Once you've selected the encrypted file, click the "Decrypt" button to begin the decryption process.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enter the Password:</strong>
          <p>
            You will be prompted to enter the password that was used to encrypt the file. This password is required to unlock the file and restore it to its original form. Make sure to enter the correct password, as the decryption process will fail if the password is incorrect.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Download the Decrypted File:</strong>
          <p>
            After entering the correct password, the website will decrypt the file and automatically download it to your device. The decrypted file will be named <code>decrypted_&lt;original_filename&gt;</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why Decryption is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Decryption is essential for accessing files that have been encrypted for security purposes. Without decryption, encrypted files remain unreadable and unusable. By using this website, you can easily decrypt your files and restore them to their original state, ensuring that your data remains secure and accessible.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Successful Decryption</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use the Correct Password:</strong>
          Ensure that you enter the exact password used during encryption. The decryption process will fail if the password is incorrect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep Your Password Secure:</strong>
          Store your password in a safe place to avoid losing access to your encrypted files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Test the Process:</strong>
          If you're decrypting an important file, consider testing the process with a smaller file first to ensure everything works as expected.
        </li>
      </ul>
